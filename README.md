# simple-algebra-lib
A simple algebra library. Currently a work in progress. Jars on Maven central should be working/useable.

Current features include:
- Outputting to mathml/html forms of expressions
- Performing fairly simple pattern matching and pattern based rewriting.
  - Basic identities such as commutativity of addition implemented with pattern matching.
- Equals/hashcode implementation based on structure of expression.
